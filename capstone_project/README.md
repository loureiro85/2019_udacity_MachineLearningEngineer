The following activities are expected in order to solve the problem:

1. Data Exploration
2. Feature Scaling
3. Sample Selection
4. Feature Relevance
5. Feature Transformation - Dimensionality Reduction (with PCA)
6. Biplot Visualization
7. Cluster Creation
8. Cluster Visualization (Byplot)
9. Cluster Benchmarking (GMM vs. KNN vs. 'surfer_experience')
10. Cluster Evaluation (Silhouette Coefficient)
